This is a Markov chain text generator in the form of a twitch chat bot that generates text based on previous chat messages.

I learned to make this by following these two videos so I highly recommend you watch these if you want to understand how my code works:

Theres also this random video that helped me understand how a markov chain works a little bit better. It helped me understand how the grouping of words works, though this kid groups characters instead of words:

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask under "Issues." I can't guarantee an immediate response, but I will try to check periodically.
